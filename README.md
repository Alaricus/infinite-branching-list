# Infinite Branching List Demo

The purpose of this app is to demonstrate the creation and management of an infinite branching list using React. Specifically it uses the Context API and the useReducer hook in order to manage state.

[Working example](http://alaricus.github.io/infinite-branching-list)

The project initially started as a quick demo for a friend who was struggling with managing the state of an unknown shape, but then I decided to publish it so that all those who could benefit from it would have access to it. If one day I get to actually clean it up at some point, I might write a tutorial to go along with it. At this point, I feel like it could use quite a bit of polish before it's tutorial material. If you feel like helping, go ahead, the reducer in particular could use some love.
